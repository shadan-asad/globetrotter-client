git clone https://github.com/shadan-asad/globetrotter-client.git
cd globetrotter-client
```

2. **Install dependencies**

3. **Configure environment**

The application uses environment files to manage API URLs for different environments. These are located in `src/environments/`.

- `environment.ts`: Default environment configuration
- `environment.development.ts`: Development environment configuration
- `environment.production.ts`: Production environment configuration

Update the API URLs in these files to point to your backend service:

```typescript
// src/environments/environment.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'https://your-api-url.com/api'
};
```

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
